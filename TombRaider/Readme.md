##Tomb Raider Reshade profile
This profile is for Reshade v1.0. It's not tested for later reshade versions, although it might work.
The shaders could give a couple of warnings after compilation, that's fine. 

Features enabled, by set. When a toggle key is bound, it's mentioned with the effect.

SweetFX:
* Bloom
* LumaSharpen
* Vibrance

Bloom can be a bit bright in direct sunlight, but that's the whole idea: in bright sunlight things
are.... bright ;)
