## Reshade Profiles
Small collection of profiles I created for Reshade with various games. See the readme's in the folders for 
the games listed. 

### Usage
Per game folder you'll find a 'Reshade' folder. This is the folder you have to copy as-is into the game folder
where you already *manually* installed reshade. This means you overwrite the `Reshade` folder's cfg files. The 
folders here don't contain reshade shader files, so it is essential you already have a `Reshade` installation
present in the game's folder. 

Not all shaders are for Reshade 1.1 or later. If shaders are for earlier versions (e.g. 1.0), it's likely 
they won't work for 1.1 or higher and you have to manually copy over the contents of the .cfg files. This
isnt that hard, all readmes contain the enabled effects, so you only have to copy those. 

Happy gaming!
