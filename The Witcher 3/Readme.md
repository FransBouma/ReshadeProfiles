##The Witcher 3 Reshade profile
This profile is for Reshade v1.0. It's not tested for later reshade versions, although it might work.
The shaders could give a couple of warnings after compilation, that's fine. 

Features enabled, by set. When a toggle key is bound, it's mentioned with the effect.

* SMAA. Enabled by default.
